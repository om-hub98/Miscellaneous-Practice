Q1) What is Synchronization?
=> Synchronization is a mechanism of handling the shared resource so that two or more thread would not
access the same block of code or resources at the same time.

Q2) How to implement synchronization?
=> By using synchronize keyword in method or in block of code.
For example :
    i) synchronizing method :
             public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
                // code to be synchronized
             }
    ii) synchronizing block of code :
            public void method() {
                synchronized (this) {
                    // code to be synchronized
                }
            }

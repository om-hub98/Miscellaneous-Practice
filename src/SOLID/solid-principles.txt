Q) What is a S.O.L.I.D design principles?
=> S - Single Responsibility Principle [ SRP ]
   O - Open Close Principle            [ OCP ]
   L - Liskov Substitution Principle   [ LSP ]
   I - Interface Segregation Principle [ ISP ]
   D - Dependency Inversion Principle  [ DIP ]

   1) SRP - Single Responsiblity Principle
   =>  Each class have their own functionality.
       Classes should not be filled with lots of responsibility.

   2) OCP - Open Close Principle
   => Classes shouold be open for extension
       but close for modification.

       In other words - we should not rewrite an existing class for
       implementing new functionality.
